The operation consisting of releasing a new version of this repository is automated by a set of tasks within the root `<%= options[:rake] ? 'R' : 'M' %>akefile`.
In this context, a version number have the following format:

      <major>.<minor>.<patch>[-b<build>]

where:

* `< major >` corresponds to the major version number
* `< minor >` corresponds to the minor version number
* `< patch >` corresponds to the patching version number
* (eventually) `< build >` states the build number _i.e._ the total number of commits within the `<%= FalkorLib::GitFlow.branches(:develop) %>` branch.

Example: \`1.0.0-b28\`

The current version number is stored in the root file `VERSION`. __/!\ NEVER MAKE ANY MANUAL CHANGES TO THIS FILE__

For more information on the version, run:

     $> <%= options[:make] ? 'make versioninfo' : 'rake version:info' %>

If a new version number such be bumped, you simply have to run:

      $> <%= options[:make] ? 'make start_bump_{major,minor,patch}' : 'rake version:bump:{major,minor,patch}' %>

This will start the release process for you using `git-flow`.
Once you have finished to commit your last changes, make the release effective by running:

      $> <%= options[:make] ? 'make release' : 'rake version:release' %>

It will finish the release using `git-flow`, create the appropriate tag in the `<%=  FalkorLib::GitFlow.branches(:master) %>` branch and merge all things the way they should be.
