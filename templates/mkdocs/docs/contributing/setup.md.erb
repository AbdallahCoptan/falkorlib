__Git Branching Model__

The Git branching model for this repository follows the guidelines of
[gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) (see also [this description](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)).
In particular, the central repository holds two main branches with an infinite lifetime:

* `<%= config[:gitflow][:branches][:master] %>`: the *production-ready* branch
* `<%= config[:gitflow][:branches][:develop] %>`: the main branch where the latest developments interviene. This is the *default* branch you get when you clone the repository.

Thus you are more than encouraged to install the [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) extensions following the [installation procedures](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Installation) to take full advantage of the proposed operations. The associated [bash completion](https://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion) might interest you also.

__Repository Setup__

As mentioned in the [installation notes](../setup/install.md), to make your local copy of the repository ready to use the [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) workflow

<% if config[:make] %>
    $> make setup
<% else %>
    $> rake setup
<% end %>

This will also initiate the [Git submodules of this repository](.gitmodules) for this repository.
