## Documentation

See `docs/`.

The documentation for this project is handled by [`mkdocs`](http://www.mkdocs.org/#installation).
You might wish to generate locally the docs:

* Install [`mkdocs`](http://www.mkdocs.org/#installation)
* Preview your documentation from the project root by running `mkdocs serve` and visit with your favorite browser the URL `http://localhost:8000`
     - Alternatively, you can run `make doc` at the root of the repository.
* (eventually) build the full documentation locally (in the `site/` directory) by running `mkdocs build`.
