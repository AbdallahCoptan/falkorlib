## <%= config[:name] %> Gem Installation

You'll typically want to install <%= config[:name] %> using [Bundler](http://bundler.io/).
To do this, simply add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

	gem '<%= config[:name].downcase %>'
	
And then execute:

	$> bundle

Or install it yourself as:

	$> gem install <%= config[:name].downcase %>

**Note** you probably wants to do the above within an isolated environment. See
  below for some explanation on this setup.
