### [Git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)

The Git branching model for this repository follows the guidelines of
[gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
In particular, the central repository holds two main branches with an infinite lifetime:

* `<%= FalkorLib::GitFlow.branches(:master) %>`: the *production-ready* branch
* `<%= FalkorLib::GitFlow.branches(:develop) %>`: the main branch where the latest developments interviene. This is the *default* branch you get when you clone the repository.

Thus you are more than encouraged to install the [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) extensions following the [installation procedures](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Installation) to take full advantage of the proposed operations. The associated [bash completion](https://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion) might interest you also.

### Releasing mechanism

The operation consisting of releasing a new version of this repository is automated by a set of tasks within the root `<%= config[:rake] ? 'R' : 'M' %>akefile`.

In this context, a version number have the following format:

      <major>.<minor>.<patch>[-b<build>]

where:

* `< major >` corresponds to the major version number
* `< minor >` corresponds to the minor version number
* `< patch >` corresponds to the patching version number
* (eventually) `< build >` states the build number _i.e._ the total number of commits within the `<%= FalkorLib::GitFlow.branches(:develop) %>` branch.

Example: \`1.0.0-b28\`

The current version number is stored in the root file `VERSION`. __/!\ NEVER MAKE ANY MANUAL CHANGES TO THIS FILE__

For more information on the version, run:

     $> <%= config[:make] ? 'make versioninfo' : 'rake version:info' %>

If a new version number such be bumped, you simply have to run:

      $> <%= config[:make] ? 'make start_bump_{major,minor,patch}' : 'rake version:{major,minor,patch}' %>

This will start the release process for you using `git-flow`.
Once you have finished to commit your last changes, make the release effective by running:

      $> <%= config[:make] ? 'make release' : 'rake version:release' %>

it will finish the release using `git-flow`, create the appropriate tag in the `<%=  FalkorLib::GitFlow.branches(:master) %>` branch and merge all things the way they should be.
