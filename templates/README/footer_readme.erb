## Resources / Complementary information

### Git 

You should become familiar (if not yet) with Git. Consider these resources: 

* [Simple Git Guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
* [Git book](http://book.git-scm.com/index.html)
* [Github:help](http://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git/)
* [Git reference](http://gitref.org/)

At least, you shall configure the following variables

    $> git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"
    $> git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com
    # configure colors
    $> git config --global color.diff auto
    $> git config --global color.status auto
    $> git config --global color.branch auto

You might want also to configure various aliases to Git command.
Consider my personal [`.gitconfig`](https://github.com/Falkor/dotfiles/blob/master/git/.gitconfig) as an example -- if you decide to use it, simply copy it in your home directory and adapt the `[user]` section. 

### [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)

The Git branching model for this repository follows the guidelines of
[gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
In particular, the central repository holds two main branches with an infinite lifetime:

* `<%= config[:gitflow][:branches][:master] %>`: the *production-ready* branch
* `<%= config[:gitflow][:branches][:develop] %>`: the main branch where the latest developments interviene. This is the *default* branch you get when you clone the repository.

### Releasing mechanism

The operation consisting of releasing a new version of this repository is automated by a set of tasks within the root `<%= config[:rake] ? 'R' : 'M' %>akefile`.

In this context, a version number have the following format:

      <major>.<minor>.<patch>[-b<build>]

where:

* `< major >` corresponds to the major version number
* `< minor >` corresponds to the minor version number
* `< patch >` corresponds to the patching version number
* (eventually) `< build >` states the build number _i.e._ the total number of commits within the `<%= config[:gitflow][:branches][:develop] %>` branch.

Example: \`1.0.0-b28\`

The current version number is stored in the root file `VERSION`. __/!\ NEVER MAKE ANY MANUAL CHANGES TO THIS FILE__

For more information on the version, run:

     $> <%= config[:make] ? 'make versioninfo' : 'rake version:info' %>

If a new version number such be bumped, you simply have to run:

      $> <%= config[:make] ? 'make start_bump_{major,minor,patch}' : 'rake version:{major,minor,patch}' %>

This will start the release process for you using `git-flow`.
Once you have finished to commit your last changes, make the release effective by running:

      $> <%= config[:make] ? 'make release' : 'rake version:release' %>

it will finish the release using `git-flow`, create the appropriate tag in the `<%= config[:gitflow][:branches][:master] %>` branch and merge all things the way they should be.
